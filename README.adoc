= SVG Compressor

A small Ruby script for compressing SVGs that contain base64 encoded PNGs

== Installation

To get started and download dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:bsmth/svg-compressor.git
cd svg-compressor
bundle install
```

The SVGO tool is also a prerequisite:

```
npm install -g svgo
```

To run from anywhere, add the script to your shell:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/svg-compressor
```

== Usage

To recursively convert SVGs in all subdirectories, run:

```bash
svg-compressor.rb <quality>
```

The jpeg compression quality can be set using `quality` with an integer value of `1`-`100` (1 being lowest quality and highest compression rate).

The SVG XML itself is then compressed and formatted using an https://github.com/tribune/svgo_wrapper[SVGO wrapper].
